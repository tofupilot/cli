//! Budget-driven degradation for oversized `StationEvent`s.
//!
//! Why this exists
//! ---------------
//! The CLI publishes every `StationEvent` as ONE inbound WebSocket frame
//! to Centrifugo, which caps client frames at `message_size_limit`
//! (65536 bytes by default, not overridden in our deployment). Over that,
//! Centrifugo closes the connection with close code 1009 -- and 1009 is
//! terminal in the client SDK (`reconnect: false`), while the station
//! daemon's broker supervisor only connects once at boot. Net effect of a
//! single oversized event: the station goes offline on the dashboard and
//! stops streaming for the rest of the process's life, silently. The run
//! itself survives and still uploads over HTTP, which is exactly why the
//! failure reads as a flaky dashboard rather than as a bug.
//!
//! Several variants carry unbounded operator data and can cross the line:
//! `UiRequest` (an inline `data:` image), `PhaseLog` / `PlugLog`
//! (a verbose dump), `PhaseComplete` (per-attempt logs and measurement
//! values), `MeasurementUpdate` (a spectrum or trace), `RunCrashed`
//! (a long traceback).
//!
//! So instead of publishing a frame we know is fatal, we publish a
//! degraded copy: the prompt survives without its image, the log line
//! survives truncated. Degradation always beats a dead station.
//!
//! Wire compatibility
//! ------------------
//! Every reduction here only removes or shortens EXISTING fields, or
//! swaps a component for another already-known `ComponentType`. No new
//! field, no new variant -- so the generated TypeScript
//! (`packages/shared/types/generated/station-protocol.ts`) is unchanged
//! and no dashboard/kiosk work is needed to consume this.
